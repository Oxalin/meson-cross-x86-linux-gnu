Meson cross file for x86 Linux compiler
=====================================================

This file is based on a 64bit Linux system (Archlinux actually). you may have to modify the binaries part so that it can point the tools on your system.

One can install Archlinux' meson-cross-x86-linux-gnu package from AUR if needed.
